Roboduck creates a config file at `~/.roboduck/config.yaml`. This currently supports only two fields:
- `openai_api_key`: See the [Quickstart](https://hdmamin.github.io/roboduck/) for setup help
- `model_name` (optional): Roboduck is configured to use gpt-3.5-turbo by default. This field lets you change that (e.g. to gpt-4). If present in the config file, this will take priority over any model_name field specified in a chat template (e.g. https://github.com/hdmamin/roboduck/blob/7ff904972921fd3f82b8b9fd862c4ffc7b61aee4/lib/roboduck/prompts/chat/debug.yaml#L2). You can view valid options with `roboduck.available_models()`. You can still override the config default by manually passing a value into a function, e.g. `duck(model_name='gpt-4-32k')`.
