    "- [x] enable load_prompt/kwargs etc in LMdb init\n",
    "- [x] consider how we filter locals and globals (currently filter out everything w/ a leading underscore and also do some rather clumsy filtering to make sure global is used in script. But might be able to do better here.)\n",
    "- [x] consider whether to rm some fields (header, globals, code_full) from get_prompt_kwargs method OR include them in prompt\n",
    "- consider if there's a good way to make this more conversational in case we need to ask multiple questions. If we just print gpt's response, this won't work so well. Could try to revise this to fit into ConvManager paradigm.\n",
    "- consider tweaking prompt to use proxy/authority (e.g. \"Answer Key\")\n",
    "- consider adding option for \"I don't know\"\n",
    "    - Or maybe something like \"If you don't know what's causing the bug, say \"I don't know\". Then write a list of 5 plausible causes that the developer can check for when debugging.\" (take advantage of its strength at generating list, thinking of possibilities we might not)\n",
    "- consider how to handle huge data structures (big df, long list, etc.)\n",
    "~ - See if we can get this to work like ipdb where you can call it only AFTER an error occurs.\n",
    "- hide user warning about using codex model name.\n",

    "UPDATE: Something weird going on here. Openai response sometimes looks normal, sometimes very weird (like function was called many times repeatedly - maybe some multiproc/multithreaded thing happening?). When I tried hardcoding other backends (search \"partial\" or see DebugMagic.lmdb method), the reply appears to be empty. However, the global var `_roboduck_last_completion` gets updated with the expected response. Might be related to the sys.displayhook usage in the self.shell.debugger call (uncomment the source.getlines calls in the DebugMagic.lmdb method).\n",

    "- maybe update prompt(s) to indicate that we are inside a debugger? Otherwise it might be confusing -  if all locals are params, it might seem like we're just telling gpt3 the args.\n",
    "    - should we be passing in 1 code snippet but a whole sequence of states? That might be better.\n",
    "- Think more about whether main use case is error explanation (in which case customized stack trace like pretty_errors might make more sense), natural language debugging (in which case we want to focus more on the conversational/sequential nature, maintain series of states, etc.), or static analysis (in which case a jupyter extension or magic that lets us type questions might be ideal).\n",

First read my question, then examine the snippet of code that is causing the issue and look at the values of the local and global variables. If you see a function called roboduck, ignore it. In the section titled SOLUTION PART 1, use plain English to explain what the problem is and how to fix it. In the section titled SOLUTION PART 2, write a corrected version of the input code snippet. If you don't know what the problem is, SOLUTION PART 1 should list a few possible causes or things I could try in order to identify the issue and SOLUTION PART 2 should say N/A.
