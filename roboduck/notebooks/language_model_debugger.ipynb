    "- [x] consider whether to rm some fields (header, globals, code_full) from get_prompt_kwargs method OR include them in prompt\n",
    "- consider if there's a good way to make this more conversational in case we need to ask multiple questions. If we just print gpt's response, this won't work so well. Could try to revise this to fit into ConvManager paradigm.\n",
    "- consider tweaking prompt to use proxy/authority (e.g. \"Answer Key\")\n",
    "- consider adding option for \"I don't know\"\n",
    "    - Or maybe something like \"If you don't know what's causing the bug, say \"I don't know\". Then write a list of 5 plausible causes that the developer can check for when debugging.\" (take advantage of its strength at generating list, thinking of possibilities we might not)\n",
    "- consider how to handle huge data structures (big df, long list, etc.)\n",
    "~ - See if we can get this to work like ipdb where you can call it only AFTER an error occurs.\n",

    "UPDATE: Something weird going on here. Openai response sometimes looks normal, sometimes very weird (like function was called many times repeatedly - maybe some multiproc/multithreaded thing happening?). When I tried hardcoding other backends (search \"partial\" or see DebugMagic.lmdb method), the reply appears to be empty. However, the global var `_roboduck_last_completion` gets updated with the expected response. Might be related to the sys.displayhook usage in the self.shell.debugger call (uncomment the source.getlines calls in the DebugMagic.lmdb method).\n",

    "    - should we be passing in 1 code snippet but a whole sequence of states? That might be better.\n",
    "- Think more about whether main use case is error explanation (in which case customized stack trace like pretty_errors might make more sense), natural language debugging (in which case we want to focus more on the conversational/sequential nature, maintain series of states, etc.), or static analysis (in which case a jupyter extension or magic that lets us type questions might be ideal).\n",
