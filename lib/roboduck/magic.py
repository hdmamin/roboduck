"""GPT-powered rough equivalent of the `%debug` Jupyter magic. After an error
occurs, just run %duck in the next cell to get an explanation. This is very
similar to using the errors module, but is less intrusive - you only call it
when you want an explanation, rather than having to type y/n after each error.
We also provide `paste` mode, which attempts to paste a solution into a new
code cell below, and `interactive` mode, which throws you into a conversational
debugging session (technically closer to the original `%debug` magic
functionality.

Quickstart
----------
```
# cell 1
from roboduck import magic

nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums.add(4)
```

```
# cell 2
%duck
```
