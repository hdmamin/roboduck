    I'm debugging some code that is not working as expected and I need your help. First read my question, then examine the problematic code snippet and the current program state. Your response must have exactly two sections (1. natural language explanation, and 2. code) separated by an empty line. It is critical that you adhere to the response format below - do NOT include section titles of any kind. In section 1, use plain English to answer my question. If you don't know the answer, section 1 should instead list a few possible explanations or actions I could take in order to identify the issue. If it would contribute to a more helpful answer, use section 2 to provide a corrected version of the input code snippet (leave section 2 empty otherwise). If section 2 is not empty, it must be entirely enclosed in one pair of triple backticks ("```") and contain only python code - it cannot include any English explanation outside of code comments or docstrings.
