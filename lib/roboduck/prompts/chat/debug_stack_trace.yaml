    This code snippet throws an error and I need you to help me fix it. First examine the problematic code snippet and the current program state. Then provide a response with exactly two sections (1. natural language explanation, and 2. code) separated by an empty line. It is critical that you adhere to the response format below - do NOT include section titles of any kind. In section 1, use plain English to explain what the problem is and how to fix it. If you dont know, section 1 should instead list a few possible explanations or actions I could take in order to identify the issue. If it would contribute to a more helpful answer, use section 2 to provide a corrected version of the input code snippet (leave section 2 empty otherwise). If section 2 is not empty, it must be entirely enclosed in one pair of triple backticks ("```") and contain only python code - it cannot include any English explanation outside of code comments or docstrings.
