**rubber duck debugging**: a method of debugging code by articulating a problem in spoken or written natural language. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)]

**robo duck debugging**: a bit like rubber duck debugging, but the duck talks back.

## About

Many AI-powered dev tools help you write boilerplate more quickly, but the hardest and most time-consuming part of programming is often the last mile. Roboduck's goal is to help you understand and fix those bugs. It essentially embeds an LLM (large language model) in the Python interpreter, providing drop-in natural language replacements for Python's standard approaches to:  
- debugging  
- error handling  
- logging  

## Quickstart

### Install

```
pip install roboduck
```

### API Key Setup

You need an openai API key to begin using roboduck. Once you have an account ([sign up here](https://platform.openai.com/signup)), you can visit https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys to retrieve your key. Your simplest option is then to call `roboduck.set_openai_api_key(api_key, update_config=True)` which essentially does the following: 

```bash
mkdir ~/.roboduck
echo "openai_api_key: your_api_key" > ~/.roboduck/config.yaml
```

Manually setting an OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable also works.

Roboduck does not store your API key or collect any usage data.

### Debugger

We provide a natural language equivalent of python's built-in `breakpoint` function. Once you're in an interactive session, you can use the standard pdb commands to navigate your code (cmd+f "debugger commands" [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html). TLDR: type `n` to execute the next line, a variable name to view its current value, or `q` to quit the debugging session). However, you can also type a question like "Why do we get an index error when j changes from 3 to 4?" or "Why does nums have three 9s in it when the input list only had one?". Concretely, any time you type something including a question mark, an LLM will try to answer. This is not just performing static analysis - the LLM can access information about the current state of your program.

```
from roboduck import duck

def bubble_sort(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[j] > nums[j + 1]:
                nums[j + 1] = nums[j]
                nums[j] = nums[j + 1]
                duck()   # <--------------------------- instead of breakpoint()
    return nums

nums = [3, 1, 9, 2, 1]
bubble_sort(nums)
```

### Errors

Roboduck is also good at explaining error messages.  Importing the errors module automatically enables *optional* error explanations. `errors.disable()` reverts to python's regular behavior on errors. `errors.enable()` can be used to re-enable error explanations or to change settings. For example, setting auto=True automatically explains all errors rather than asking the user if they want an explanation (y/n) when an error occurs (this is probably excessive for most use cases, but you're free to do it).

```
from roboduck import errors

data = {'x': 0}
y = data.x

errors.disable()
y = data.x

errors.enable(auto=True)
y = data.x
```

### Jupyter Magic

Jupyter provides a `%debug` magic that can be used after an error occurs to enter a postmortem debugging session. Roboduck's `%duck` magic works similarly, but with all of our debugging module's conversational capabilities:

```
# cell 1
from roboduck import magic

nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums.add(4)
```

```
# cell 2
%duck
```

### Logging

Roboduck also provides a logger that can write to stdout and/or a file. Whenever you log an Exception object, an LLM will try to diagnose and suggest a fix for the problem. (Unlike the debug module, the logger does not type responses live because we assume logs will typically be viewed after the fact.)

```
from roboduck import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(path='/tmp/log.txt')
data = {'x': 0}
try:
    x = data.x
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(e)
```

### CLI

You can also run a python script with error explanations enabled:

```bash
duck my_script.py
```

Run `duck --help` for more info.
