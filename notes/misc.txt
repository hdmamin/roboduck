Sequential Chain
{input_vars} -> render prompt 1 -> {output_str1} 
{output_str1} -> input to prompt 2 -> render prompt 2 -> {output_str1, output_str2}

I want
{input_vars} -> render prompt 1 -> {output_str1}
{concat(render_prompt1, output_str1)} -> input to prompt 2 -> render prompt 2 -> {output_str2}
    (But also along the way, store output of each step in a way we can access later.)

Take the inputs and pass to our first chain.
Then concat the first chain's prompt to its output.

Chain 0
[system msg, first question] -> first answer
[system msg, first question, first answer, second question] -> second answer
[system msg, first question, first answer, second question, second answer, third question] -> third answer

approaches O(n^2) wrt encoding questions (i.e. first question is encoded n times where n is number of questions). Whereas if we make this a single prompt, encoding is O(n) (i.e. each section is encoded once).
